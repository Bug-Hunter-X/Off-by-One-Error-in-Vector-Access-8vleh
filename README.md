# Off-by-One Error in C++
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when accessing elements of a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.  The error results from an incorrect loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an element beyond the vector's bounds.  This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or data corruption.  Understanding and avoiding such errors is crucial for writing robust and reliable C++ code.
